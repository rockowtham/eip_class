Convolution 
================

    Convolution is the product of two function and produces the third function expressing how the shape of one function is getting modified by another

Filters/Kernels 
=================

         The kernel is the small/Subset of the given input matrix of the selected size, It moves over the each step of the input matrix to arrive the calculated output.
    

Epochs
==========

      Epoch is once all images are processed individually both forward and backward

1x1 Convolution 
=================

          Mapping all its input pixel through its channel to the output pixel without considering anything around
          

3x3 Convolution
==================

        If we apply 3x3 convolution on the images it always has the 3rd Dimension in size

Feature Map
==============

  The term Feature Map is a map representing the features extracted through one or more layers of convolution.
  
Activation Function 
========================

    Activation function decides, whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias with it. The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.
  
Receptive Field
==================

      The receptive field  is the discrete range of input selected as input to the convolution kernel of a specific layer.
